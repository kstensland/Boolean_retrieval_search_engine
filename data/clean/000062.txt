john
manard
super
review
ye
i
seen
the
fabl
version
of
thi
much
hype
epic
cgi
film
and
my
end
thought
ar
not
bad
actual
no
where
near
as
great
as
hype
as
i
expect
but
it
good
firstli
the
plot
it
with
wolv
straight
n
simpl
thei
even
had
we
studi
voic
the
chief
it
a
complet
rip
of
the
film
and
a
few
other
like
last
samurai
not
much
differ
and
quit
blatant
it
just
set
in
the
futur
with
alien
that
all
it
total
predict
right
down
to
the
last
minut
it
not
origin
in
the
slightest
and
it
realli
basic
and
formula
right
down
to
the
epic
battl
at
the
end
which
is
in
the
same
vein
as
war
and
imagin
and
design
thi
is
a
mixtur
realli
on
on
side
you
have
tremend
thought
into
the
world
the
creatur
that
roam
the
planet
plant
life
natur
and
it
cycl
some
thing
look
good
and
some
ar
just
a
redesign
of
certain
live
thing
in
our
own
time
rhino
but
still
look
good
the
colour
and
vista
on
show
ar
stun
a
real
treat
for
the
optic
as
you
enter
a
neon
natur
reserv
in
place
with
abund
plant
life
and
micro
organ
that
float
through
the
air
veri
impress
the
alien
home
world
of
is
probabl
the
most
visual
epic
note
in
the
film
it
look
gorgeou
and
cover
the
full
colour
palett
with
jungl
beach
coastlin
and
forest
even
though
it
doe
look
just
a
littl
like
the
wooki
planet
of
vi
at
first
i
did
like
the
look
of
these
gui
and
dure
the
start
of
the
film
i
still
did
as
the
film
progress
and
you
see
more
of
the
tribe
and
their
battl
gear
cloth
tribal
wear
did
becom
clear
that
a
whole
load
of
thought
and
research
had
gone
into
make
these
alien
come
across
as
a
real
cultur
and
race
refer
to
nativ
american
indian
as
an
influenc
to
the
stori
which
is
veri
clear
but
i
also
felt
an
african
tribal
feel
to
the
vi
too
the
detail
on
war
paint
jeweleri
hair
weapon
tribal
mark
and
the
same
with
the
planet
creatur
in
bodi
mark
colour
pattern
and
even
sound
effect
for
their
growl
and
roar
wa
highli
impress
it
just
a
shame
the
film
wa
quit
as
grown
up
or
matur
like
all
thi
wonder
natur
research
and
design
the
militari
aspect
is
good
but
all
too
familiar
for
me
there
is
a
clear
heavi
presenc
of
cameron
here
with
all
the
ship
look
like
the
drop
ship
from
the
similar
clich
marin
charact
and
he
basic
put
hi
power
loader
back
in
there
or
nick
them
from
matrix
i
also
think
we
all
know
that
the
marin
and
their
tech
do
have
a
tendenc
to
remind
us
of
other
franchis
from
both
film
and
videogam
background
also
i
think
there
a
small
presenc
in
the
film
too
with
the
some
part
of
the
alien
natur
world
colour
scheme
neon
transluc
and
some
creatur
design
ok
let
get
thi
right
thi
film
is
all
it
onli
in
certain
scene
with
mani
be
regular
vision
the
film
actual
look
better
in
for
the
most
part
as
the
colour
ar
brighter
without
the
spec
the
wa
a
let
down
for
me
big
time
it
not
realli
if
you
ask
me
anywai
there
ar
veri
few
moment
where
you
feel
your
be
in
the
face
whether
thei
aim
for
that
i
not
sure
it
mere
peopl
in
the
foreground
look
sharper
than
the
background
veri
blurai
basic
the
background
actual
be
slightli
blur
which
wa
poor
another
thing
wa
when
the
action
did
unfold
in
it
wa
quit
hard
to
follow
as
again
it
blur
a
bit
and
just
came
across
too
strongli
i
could
quit
focu
on
the
frenzi
action
as
it
wa
errrr
a
frenzi
fast
hectic
action
and
blur
in
the
background
a
veri
odd
sensat
cgi
final
we
come
to
thi
i
got
ta
admit
it
wa
good
in
place
it
wa
damn
good
the
facial
express
on
some
main
charact
wa
excel
and
the
sceneri
of
the
planet
wa
fantast
but
i
would
sai
it
as
good
as
it
ha
been
trumpet
the
dialog
scene
and
close
up
ar
veri
good
but
the
battl
sequenc
do
lose
it
somewhat
thei
ar
more
obviou
if
you
ask
me
the
whole
film
did
still
seem
more
like
a
videogam
than
a
proper
film
albeit
a
veri
good
in
game
sequenc
there
were
also
some
odd
point
when
left
hi
avatar
on
regular
occas
what
happen
to
it
wa
hi
avatar
alwai
sleep
when
he
left
and
when
he
did
come
back
to
hi
avatar
it
alwai
seem
fine
even
when
thei
were
all
bomb
to
piec
in
the
big
tree
sequenc
you
would
of
thought
hi
lifeless
avatar
would
of
been
burnt
up
how
come
the
vi
still
believ
in
him
and
follow
him
into
battl
when
thei
know
he
human
and
a
fake
did
all
the
big
tree
have
that
metal
beneath
them
or
just
the
if
so
the
human
could
of
gone
and
dug
elsewher
overal
i
did
like
the
film
mainli
the
detail
on
the
and
their
wai
of
life
but
wa
disappoint
with
the
stori
line
and
the
wai
it
pan
out
it
wa
all
plai
out
or
set
up
like
on
of
the
new
war
film
plod
along
up
until
the
final
big
showdown
battl
sequenc
acting
in
gener
wa
fine
but
noth
special
no
stand
out
perform
if
you
ask
me
a
cult
in
year
to
come
i
sure
over
hype
probabl
ye
the
aspect
sold
more
ticket
i
bet
but
realli
wa
there
ani
need
for
the
could
almost
sai
thi
wa
matrix
of
the
00
the
next
gen
film
to
rock
the
foundat
of
the
film
and
world
just
like
war
did
back
in
it
could
of
been
but
for
me
it
is
it
a
darn
good
film
and
worthi
or
much
prais
but
ye
it
over
hype
badli
great
effect
in
place
but
nasti
obviou
cgi
in
other
whilst
the
plot
is
the
true
let
down
veri
close
to
be
a
monster
epic
but
for
me
it
doe
quit
reach

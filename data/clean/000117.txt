of

terrifi
the

made
of

we
found
strang

the

first
tryst
one

deceiv
the
viciou
vigil
of
her
famili
in
a
nervou
and
mimosa
grove
at
the
back
of
their
villa
we
found
a
perch
on
the
ruin
of
a
low
stone
wall
through
the
dark
and
the
tender
tree
we
could
see
the
arabesqu
of
light

which
touch
up
by
the

appear
to
me
now
like

seem
as
nake
as
she
wa
under

i
saw
her
face
in

strang
distinct
as
if
it
emit
a
faint
radianc
of
it
own
her
leg
her
love
live

were
not

togeth
and
when
my

locat
what
it
sought
a

eeri
express
came
over
those
childish
featur
she
sat
a
littl
higher
than

whenev
in

solitari
ecstasi
she
wa
led
to
kiss
me
her
head
would
bend
with
a
sleepi
soft
droop
movement
that
wa
almost
woeful
and
her
bare
knee
caught
and
compress
my
wrist
and
slacken
again
and
her
quiver
mouth
distort
by
the
acrid
of
some
mysteri
potion
with
a
sibil
intak
of
breath
came
near
to
my

she
would
try
to
reliev
the
pain
of
love
by
first
roughli
rub
her
dry
lip
against
mine
then
my
darl
would
draw
awai
with
a
nervou
toss
of
her

and
then
again
come
darkli
near
and
let
me
feed
on

with

on
that
i
had
place
in

and
just
never
dare
to
bui
as
nabokov
explain
through
hi

introduct
thi

so
if
that
is
what

you
better
put

someth
els
thi
is
in

not
to
sai
it
is
not
a
mess
up

stori
becaus
it
is
about
a
fulli
adult
male
and
a
twelv
year
old
girl
whichregardless
of
how
you
look
at
it
is
all
sort
of
interest
thing
here
is
that
if
you
replac
pedophilia
with
just
about
ani
other
romanc
it
becom
on
hell
of
a
romant
concept
what
nabokov

is

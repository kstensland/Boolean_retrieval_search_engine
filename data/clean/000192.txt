do
you

how
annoi
that
is
okai
let
quickli
get
into
thi
the
white
realli
like
the
white
witch
from
the
moment
we
first
see
her
in
the
novel
i
think
my
like
for
her
carri
over
from
the
movi
ye
i
saw
the
movi
first
and
i
never
read
thi
as
a
kid
but
for
the
most
part
she
wa
still
pretti
awesom
in
the
book
well
sort
of
lewi
kind
of
brag
about
aslan
a
bit
or
a
lot
all
the
time
so
the
white
witch
get
made
fun
of
i
know
some
of
you
might
sai
well
it
a
kid
book
and
for
children
at
the
time
thei
were
realli
care
on
what
went
into
the
book
and
how
frighten
or
sad
it
wa
lewi
doe
shut
up
about
it
either
he
mention
it
a
few
time
like
oh
i
would
show
you
thi
or
i
would
tell
you
thi
but
if
i
did
believ
me
you
be
allow
to
read
thi
book
so
i
understand
that
he
might
felt
the
need
to
portrai
aslan
as
veri
strong
and
mighti
even
when
he
wa
shown
as
weak
and
to
give
the
impress
that
everyth
is
go
to
be
okai
for
the
children
you
know
but
for
me
and
i
not
a
kid
it
not
so
fun
and
get
bore
becaus
all
the
suspens
is
gone
mayb
that
why
i
realli
like
the
witch
she
brought
with
her
a
kind
of
evil
and
power
and
she
a
woman
and
she
rule
i
do
care
if
she
not
suppos
to
she
pretti
awesom
and
she
fear
in
the
movi
she
seem
realli
realli
proud
to
me
and
i
like
that
i
kind
of
imagin
her
like
that
in
the
book
too
but
then
lewi
give
us
thi
roar
aslan
half
rise
from
hi
throne
and
hi
great
mouth
open
wider
and
wider
and
the
roar
grew
louder
and
louder
and
the
witch
after
stare
for
a
moment
with
her
lip
wide
apart
pick
up
her
skirt
and
fairli
ran
for
her
life
no
pleas
she
mai
not
have
her
wand
but
i
do
think
she
would
up
her
skirt
and
run
for
her
life
that
just
not
like
her
yeah
yeah
it
lewi
charact
and
what
do
i
know
but
serious
peopl
author
alwai
screw
up
their
charact
without
notic
i
believ
thi
is
just
to
show
us
that
the
mighti
aslan
is
fear
by
all
and
if
that
the
witch
is
scare
of
him
yai
everyth
will
be
okai
i
also
do
like
the
idea
that
she
shown
as
bad
like
she
entir
evil
just
becaus
she
half
jinn
and
half
giant
ye
ye
it
a
children
book
and
the
evil
gui
is
just
evil
and
need
to
die
but
let
ignor
that
for
a
few
moment
i
heard
all
about
how
thi
book
is
full
of
christian
theme
and
idea
but
ar
not
christian
ar
thei
i
do
think
thei
ar
let
me
tell
you
about
islam
there
ar
human
angel
and
jinn
the
human
were
made
of
you
prefer
call
it
the
angel
were
made
of
light
and
the
jinn
were
made
of
fire
out
of
the
three
creatur
onli
the
angel
ar
pure
and
ar
creat
to
obei
onli
thei
do
not
or
can
not
commit
ani
sin
so
there
ar
no
such
thing
as
fallen
angel
angel
remain
angel
and
thei
ar
power
creatur
that
serv
god
both
human
and
jinn
howev
have
free
will
thei
can
choos
either
good
ar
bad
and
thei
have
both
good
and
evil
insid
them
satan
the
devil
is
a
jinn
he
wa
thrown
down
to
earth
becaus
he
defi
god
and
hi
promis
to
him
wa
that
by
the
time
the
dai
of
judgement
arriv
he
lead
as
mani
peopl
in
to
hell
as
he
can
in
a
thousand
and
one
night
or
arabian
night
whichev
version
you
know
of
jinn
ar
portrai
as
both
good
and
evil
the
good
on
ar
call
i
think
in
the
english
translat
i
do
know
what
the
real
arabic
version
call
them
but
if
i
ever
get
my
hand
on
it
i
let
you
know
anywai
the
bad
jinn
ar
call
just
jinn
i
think
and
thei
ar
the
follow
of
ibli
which
is
just
the
name
of
the
devil
what
i
try
to
sai
is
that
just
like
human
the
jinn
have
both
good
and
bad
thei
can
be
evil
and
thei
can
be
good
so
when
the
beaver
tell
the
children
that
the
white
witch
is
all
bad
and
ha
no
good
in
her
becaus
she
half
jinn
and
half
giant
be
the
daughter
of
lilith
my
reaction
wa
me
there
is
no
lilith
in
islam
and
i
not
veri
sure
about
giant
though
i
do
think
thei
appear
in
a
thousand
and
one
night
but
thei
might
be
some
wai
associ
to
jinn
but
if
she
part
jinn
then
she
ha
some
good
in
her
dammit
lewi
burrow
all
sort
of
thing
with
hi
giant
and
tree
spirit
and
all
of
that
but
come
on
why
would
you
just
take
thi
and
insert
it
into
your
stori
just
becaus
i
know
as
a
writer
he
free
to
take
whatev
he
want
but
that
just
doe
make
sens
at
all
if
we
look
at
it
from
how
islam
view
jinn
then
there
her
name
the
white
witch
why
is
she
the
white
witch
if
she
is
realli
all
bad
why
pick
the
color
white
is
that
innoc
clean
and
a
whole
bunch
of
other
thing
in
the
west
i
guess
you
can
sai
it
becaus
the
winter
or
the
ic
but
hei
there
ar
other
color
too
there
blue
there
grai
or
he
could
just
not
go
with
color
at
all
he
could
call
her
the
ice
witch
the
winter
witch
the
snow
witch
i
do
know
we
talk
about
thi
in
class
too
like
why
white
so
i
said
well
she
half
jinn
that
wa
when
i
did
know
that
there
were
no
such
thing
as
jinn
in
christian
and
thei
were
like
is
jinn
white
i
do
realli
know
but
if
i
were
to
pick
a
color
for
jinn
it
would
be
white
i
even
went
home
and
ask
my
mother
and
she
answer
automat
without
even
think
about
it
mayb
it
becaus
in
islam
jinn
ar
be
that
live
among
our
world
but
mind
their
busi
if
you
mind
your
busi
mayb
think
of
them
as
spirit
or
ghost
hate
to
call
them
ghost
but
just
for
now
thei
invis
to
you
though
so
white
just
make
sens
mayb
it
some
influenc
of
eastern
cultur
on
me
that
i
not
awar
of
but
ye
a
ladi
jinn
white
fit
her
so
i
just
can
not
see
her
as
someon
who
is
entir
bad
or
evil
she
half
jinn
she
given
the
color
white
and
to
me
thi
woman
had
some
reason
for
do
what
she
do
i
know
in
the
stori
it
definit
no
what
the
fuck
are
you
talking
about
did
you
even
read
but
could
lewi
have
done
a
better
job
with
her
uh
yeah
come
on
jinn
ar
fascin
you
know
what
i
think
i
write
someth
about
jinn
somedai
somedai
i
swear
i
had
more
to
sai
about
her
but
move
hi
charact
is
okai
till
around
the
part
he
get
sacrif
oh
wait
no
that
not
when
he
get
that
not
it
either
oh
yeah
it
when
he
start
chase
the
girl
and
goe
yaaaai
i
a
kitti
come
plai
with
me
tickl
me
can
i
hug
you
yaaaaaayyi
oh
shit
girl
we
got
a
war
go
on
and
we
have
some
save
to
do
stop
fool
around
and
get
on
my
back
we
gon
na
go
rescu
ah
hah
ha
no
serious
doe
anyon
understand
what
happen
there
i
think
lewi
wa
try
to
make
aslan
not
seem
like
the
christ
figur
so
he
insert
that
silli
and
complet
out
of
charact
scene
in
there
i
mean
he
get
sacrif
for
protect
a
boi
for
the
greater
good
do
you
see
him
as
a
christ
figur
it
like
lewi
went
oh
crap
thi
dude
a
lion
everyon
go
to
talk
about
thi
now
and
peopl
would
hate
me
for
i
should
ask
is
it
okai
to
compar
anim
to
human
i
do
realli
know
much
about
christian
so
i
guess
i
ca
talk
much
about
aslan
buddi
when
you
roar
everyon
ran
the
fuck
awai
why
ar
you
suddenli
act
like
a
littl
babi
it
might
work
a
littl
better
if
we
saw
aslan
act
more
childlik
with
the
arriv
of
the
kid
so
suddenli
come
back
to
life
and
plai
around
a
bit
would
have
been
there
in
hi
charact
wait
wait
actual
no
no
even
if
you
sai
like
oh
it
like
a
whole
rebirth
thing
and
he
all
young
and
full
of
energi
now
do
you
not
realiz
that
there
a
war
go
on
thei
just
fool
around
for
like
hour
and
suddenli
it
all
make
no
sens
if
lewi
had
shown
him
as
a
more
love
charact
with
the
kid
befor
it
still
would
been
realli
realli
stupid
of
him
to
wast
hour
just
chase
around
the
girl
and
if
you
sai
well
when
he
plai
around
he
wa
right
on
time
for
everyth
els
that
happen
still
no
it
a
book
you
can
write
it
a
billion
wai
and
make
it
work
but
thi
doe
not
work
no
wonder
thei
cut
that
out
in
the
movi
it
complet
stupid
okai
final
to
susan
i
think
i
mention
someth
about
the
essai
i
had
to
write
when
i
wa
read
thi
book
so
that
essai
turn
into
a
comparison
between
thi
and
alice
adventur
in
wonderland
it
wa
about
cultur
war
societi
and
someth
i
do
know
but
i
talk
a
bit
about
why
thi
or
that
wa
not
includ
so
i
skip
most
of
that
here
there
on
import
question
left
though
why
wa
susan
given
a
freak
bow
and
arrow
why
wa
luci
given
a
knife
why
wa
susan
who
wa
older
than
edmund
not
particip
in
the
war
with
her
freak
amaz
bow
which
never
misses
why
would
you
give
someon
someth
that
thei
never
end
up
us
why
would
you
send
the
younger
child
to
war
why
not
send
two
of
the
older
on
and
leav
two
of
the
younger
on
to
get
a
littl
closer
edmund
treat
luci
like
shit
do
you
think
if
edmund
and
luci
spent
time
togeth
dure
that
bit
thei
get
to
know
each
other
better
more
bond
time
or
is
it
becaus
on
a
gui
and
the
other
a
girl
thei
would
like
to
be
in
each
other
compani
is
the
reason
for
edmund
be
such
an
ass
i
think
the
movi
did
a
better
job
with
thi
if
i
rememb
right
he
wa
all
grouchi
and
mean
becaus
he
miss
hi
daddi
or
both
hi
parent
i
not
sure
but
becaus
of
the
war
that
make
a
ton
of
why
doe
susan
have
such
an
amaz
weapon
if
she
does
not
use
it
she
us
it
in
the
movi
so
that
wa
good
but
realli
you
have
someth
that
will
strike
anyth
you
aim
for
and
you
do
us
it
it
just
make
no
sens
why
is
that
amaz
weapon
in
thi
book
oh
but
thi
is
onli
on
book
what
do
i
know
about
the
rest
of
the
seri
i
ask
and
they
told
me
she
does
do
any
archery
and
she
does
kick
any
you
know
that
okai
it
would
be
fine
if
susan
and
luci
were
both
shown
as
the
charact
who
were
more
caretak
support
helper
instead
of
fighter
but
why
giver
her
the
freak
bow
what
that
there
for
luci
is
given
a
dagger
and
told
to
us
it
onli
when
she
realli
need
to
a
littl
kid
given
a
dagger
in
a
time
of
war
told
it
danger
and
onli
to
us
when
she
ha
to
all
right
i
understand
she
doe
us
it
and
i
understand
she
did
need
to
instead
that
potion
heal
thing
wa
more
susan
she
given
a
horn
to
blow
when
she
need
help
and
she
given
an
amaz
freak
weapon
she
us
the
horn
but
not
that
amaz
feel
sorri
for
that
weapon

would
stick
with
me
from
that
moment
as
i
learn
to
read
the
narnia
book
were
the
first
novel
i
sunk
my
literari
teeth
into
and
to
thi
dai
i
have
read
and
re
read
the
novel
back
to
lion
the
witch
and
the
wardrob
is
a
novel
written
for
both
children
and
adult
it
contain
highli
allegor
element
as
wa
a
apologet
writer
howev
he
wrote
that
he
did
not
write
hi
novel
as
a
pure
allegori
but
as
a
stori
and
that
is
what
the
lion
the
witch
and
the
wardrob
is
a
stori
to
be
enjoi
by
everyon
and
although
written
in
simpl
languag
the
reader
can
quickli
concis
and
easili
imagin
the
world
without
the
clumsi
constraint
of
overus
word
i
person
can
not
imagin
a
world
without
these
just
a
question
at
last
and
on
with
a
highli
philosoph
twist
to
it
why
is
it
that
peopl
so
readili
condemn
those
book
which
ar
consid
as
moral
tale
you
think
we
could
do
with
more
moral
in
such
a
twist
and
confus
world
regardless
of
accept
the
belief
system
2
i
have
heard
mani
peopl
describ
the
entir
seri
as
silli
and
far
too
preachi
i
do
not
see
it
that
wai
at
all
trust
me
if
want
to
be
preachi
he
would
have
written
a
lot
more
philosophi
and
less
stori
ye
i
can
see
how
some
would
call
thi
silli
but
then
i
argu
that
thei
ar
miss
the
point
it
a
fairytal
type
fantasi
intend
mainli
for
children
and
for
those
children
again
as
adult
or
for
their
parent
perhap
but
i
argu
that
as
lewi
onli
wrote
thi
stori
base
on
the
stori
of
the
crucifixion
in
mani
wai
that
it
wa
not
intend
as
a
preachi
book
my
question
is
that
why
is
it
that
if
i
were
to
base
a
stori
along
what
some
call
the
myth
it
is
claim
as
preach
while
as
if
i
were
to
base
it
on
ani
other
mytholog
or
stori
it
would
be
deem
as
mere
copi
the
theme
of
anoth
mytholog
is
thi
yet
anoth
exampl
of
doublethink

simpl

profound
enough
to

as
far
as
i
concern
thi
is
the
first
on
it
is
the
on
in
which
we
along
with
the
children
ar
introduc
to
narnia
and
everi
on
publish
after
it
follow
the
stori
in
a
wai
a
reader
can
relat
with
an
appreci
just
so
everyon
know
i
an
review
the
1970
collier
book
edit
of
lww
i
just
got
done
reread
thi
on
it
the
first
time
i
pick
it
up
in
mani
year
it
a
breez
to
get
through
which
is
sad
becaus
i
rememb
be
veri
proud
of
myself
for
get
through
it
in
the
fourth
grade
but
oh
rather
not
do
a
total
comparison
but
and
do
crucifi
me
haha
the
movi
deal
with
thi
stori
better
it
is
more
excit
the
charact
evolv
everyon
reaction
is
more
believ
and
yet
the
origin
stori
is
entir
intact
i
love
the
stori
do
get
me
wrong
but
read
the
written
work
again
after
watch
to
movi
it
just
seem
like
bare
bone
i
forgotten
how
spars
the
write
thing
i
had
forgotten
is
just
how
metafict
new
word
i
think
the
whole
thing
is
lewi
spend
an
aw
lot
of
time
referenc
the
fact
that
he
is
write
thi
book
which
is
slightli
for
modern
reader
that
would
be
forgiven
realli
if
he
did
us
it
to
not
describ
so
mani
thing
i
suppos
if
you
ar
a
veri
young
child
and
he
claim
that
someth
is
so
frighten
he
dare
not
describ
it
to
you
it
forc
that
child
to
us
her
imagin
in
order
to
fill
in
the
blank
yet
the
success
descript
of
similar
thing
in
sai
a
seri
as
popular
as
the
harri
potter
book
make
on
wonder
if
it
wa
just
a
cop
out
or
cultur
handicap
yet
there
ar
rare
place
where
thi
tecniqu
seem
to
work
in
hi
favor
such
as
place
where
he
is
describ
a
visual
sort
of
magic
he
will
write
i
suppos
you
have
seen
someth
and
then
elabor
that
thi
is
how
it
look
somewhat
thi
will
give
most
kid
a
realli
clear
pictur
of
what
is
happen
make
thi
stori
easili
read
aloud
to
children
as
young
as
i
would
sai
five
there
ar
also
veri
interest
part
where
i
find
myself
connect
to
what
go
on
on
a
veri
differ
level
and
it
is
becaus
lewi
address
the
reader
that
on
allow
oneself
to
feel
thi
wai
the
best
exampl
is
the
aftermath
of
the
great
battl
when
everyon
is
head
to
cair
paravel
to
see
the
children
crown
here
the
sea
is
describ
with
such
excit
it
doe
seem
as
if
you
ar
come
to
the
palac
yourself
the
castl
of
cair
paravel
on
it
littl
hill
tower
up
abov
them
befor
them
were
the
sand
with
rock
and
littl
pool
of
salt
water
and
sea
weed
and
the
smell
of
the
sea
and
long
mile
of
wave
break
forev
and
ever
on
the
beach
and
oh
the
cry
of
the
have
you
heard
it
can
you
rememb
thi
on
line
innoc
place
can
you
rememb
there
is
not
on
moment
in
your
mind
what
i
should
be
rememb
or
from
what
becaus
i
wa
there
can
you
rememb
becaus
lewi
is
desper
try
to
get
the
messag
across
that
we
were
all
there
and
we
have
all
heard
it
and
it
will
onli
take
a
quick
jog
of
the
memori
to
i
am
not
christian
in
fact
i
am
a
wiccan
and
have
alwai
been
distain
of
christian
who
do
whatev
thei
can
to
convert
me
lai
off
alreadi
but
that
doe
not
mean
that
i
do
know
a
good
stori
when
i
read
on
whether
or
not
lewi
is
talk
about
jesu
and
yeah
i
know
he
is
that
feel
wa
a
veri
good
on
there
ar
some
thing
you
just
have
to
let
go
you
know
it
is
the
worst
thing
in
the
world
to
have
your
kid
know
that
you
should
sacrific
your
famili
for
turkish
delight
er
as
it
were
just
like
it
is
the
worst
thing
to
have
your
kid
put
faith
in
themselv
scienc
and
other
human
endevour
as
phillip
pullman
is
teach
via
the
golden
compass
etc
in
fact
the
less
you
stress
out
about
what
philosphi
your
kid
ar
expos
to
earli
in
life
the
less
angsti
and
rebelli
thei
be
later
i
digress
what
is
import
to
note
is
a
note
of
sexism
within
thi
novel
i
did
not
notic
ani
racism
at
least
not
as
blatent
as
the
misogyn
but
there
have
been
case
brought
up
to
that
affect
as
well
once
again
wiki
it
when
father
christma
bring
the
children
their
present
he
tell
the
girl
to
onli
us
their
weapon
if
thei
truli
need
to
and
never
in
battl
when
luci
sai
she
mai
be
brave
enough
santa
sai
battl
is
ugli
when
women
fight
as
oppos
to
how
pretti
it
is
when
men
go
at
it
just
an
exampl
later
in
the
seri
it
becom
more
appar
that
lewi
felt
that
there
wa
a
place
for
women
we
do
have
to
rememb
the
time
in
which
it
wa
written
and
simpli
empow
our
girl
by
other
mean
i
honestli
do
think
that
thi
seri
will
instil
in
children
mind
the
idea
that
boi
ar
better
than
short
read
thi
becaus
it
a
classic
and
a
veri
good
but
realli
watch
the
movi
too
i
think
it
doe
a
fantast
job
of

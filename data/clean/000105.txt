the
da

code
the
truth
behind
the
code
when
i
took
the
decis
of
sit
down
and
read
the
book
it
wa
becaus
of
the
high
recommend
that
it
had
receiv
from
all
my
friend
and
teacher
i
myself
am
not
much
of
a
reader
but
as
soon
as
i
start
read
the
book
i
just
could
let
go
of
it
after
read
thi
book
i
can
certainli
sai
that
dan
brown
is
a
true
geniu
the
da
vinci
code
is
a
masterpiec
it
on
of
those
book
that
ar
uniqu
and
that
ar
alwai
go
to
be
a
must
read
it
start
out
with
a
murder
case
but
it
is
your
typic
case
of
find
out
who
it
is
dan
brown
is
sure
of
leav
more
than
evid
toward
the
true
secret
behind
thi
murder
case
that
ha
more
behind
it
than
just
a
guilti
assassin
i
assur
you
that
throughout
the
whole
journei
that
the
protagonist
robert
langdon
and
sophi
nevu
undergo
you
will
feel
the
tension
and
the
passion
for
find
out
the
secret
that
da
vinci
ha
left
for
us
you
will
feel
nervou
you
will
feel
sad
and
disappoint
when
you
ca
find
out
the
secret
and
you
will
utter
satisfact
you
will
end
up
with
an
open
mouth
it
ha
all
the
characterist
of
a
novel
that
will
make
you
enjoi
thi
book
as
if
you
robert
of
sophi
themselv
i
certain
that
you
wo
be
abl
to
think
about
anyth
els
when
you
not
read
the
book
besid
all
thi
incred
characterist
it
also
ha
a
small
dose
of
love
between
the
2
main
charact
that
throughout
the
whole
book
you
can
see
the
obviou
chemistri
that
exist
between
them
so
for
all
those
reader
who
like
the
unexpect
thi
is
your
book
when
you
sure
that
that
the
gui
or
that
thei
have
solv
the
mysteri
i
assur
you
you
will
be
wrong
the
truth
will
blow
your
mind
one
of
the
thing
that
i
most
enjoi
wa
the
fact
that
sever
thing
were
happen
at
the
same
time
with
differ
charact
the
author
give
you
just
the
amount
of
inform
about
what
happen
with
on
charact
to
leav
you
hook
and
then
will
go
and
tell
you
in
the
next
chapter
what
happen
with
the
other
charact
and
also
leave
you
hooked
so
you
wo
be
abl
to
stop
read
you
will
read
faster
and
faster
hold
your
breath
to
the
sudden
twist
the
book
take
and
be
breathless
by
the
end
of
it
although
dan
brown
literatur
as
a
whole
mai
not
be
veri
good
it
is
apt
for
mani
ag
and
great
to
be
read
as
a
fiction
fun
book
that
will
leav
you
with
a
sweet
tast
of
mouth
when
finish
the
da
vinci
code
you
will
want
to
read
more
of
dan
brown
the
da
vinci
code
is
an
amaz
book
and
i
dare
rate
it
without
a
doubt
a
5
star
book
what
great
about
dan
brown
is
that
he
doe
stop
hi
masterpiec
here
he
continu
hi
extravag
write
in
book
like
angel
and
demon
digit
fortress
and
decept
point
so
i
can
sai
without
a
doubt
that

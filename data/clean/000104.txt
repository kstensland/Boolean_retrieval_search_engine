year
after
it
initi

so
my
reaction
is
probabl
differ
than
those
who
discov
it
befor
the
hype
to
them
perhap
the
idea
were
novel

the
stori
excit
for
me
howev
the
stori
wa
so
similar
to
brown
angel

demon
that
i
found
it
predict
and
wa
abl
to
guess
some
of
the
twist
earli
on
as
a
thriller
it
definit
kept
me
read
at
point
but
i
never
got
as
lost
in
the
stori
as
i
would
have
like
i
would
onli
rate
the
mysteri
as
and
the
end
as
somewhat
disappoint
the
da

code
is
a
thriller
and
should
be
taken

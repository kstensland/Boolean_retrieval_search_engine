inception
is
proof
that
peopl
ar
not

that
cinema
is
not

that
it
is
possibl

wrote
i
found
myself
wish

weirder
further
out
the

is
nolan
labyrinth
all
the
wai
and
it
gratifi
to
experi
a
summer

with
larg
visual
ambit
and
with
noth
more
or
less
on
it
mind
than
as
shakespear
said
a

129
time
magazin
richard
corliss
wrote
the

nobl
intent
is
to
implant

the

kenneth

felt
that
nolan
wa
abl
to
blend
the
best
of
tradit
and
modern
filmmak
if
you
search
for

thi
is
what
it

and
claudia

smarter
than
thei
at
least
as
capabl
of
rise
to

invent
level
that
a
tall
order
but
it

there

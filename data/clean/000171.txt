the
period
from
1775
the
outbreak
of
the
american
revolut
to
1789
the
storm
of
the
bastil
is
the
turbul
set
of
thi
uncharacterist
dicken
novel
it
is
hi
onli
novel
that
lack
comic
relief
is
on
of
onli
two
that
ar
not
set
in
england
and
is
also
unusu
in
lack
a
primari
central
charact
london
and
pari
ar
the
real
protagonist
in
thi
tale
much
as
the
cathedr
wa
the
of
hugo
notr
dame
de
pari
dicken
wa
write
at
a
time
of
great
turmoil
in
hi
person
life
have
just
separ
from
hi
wife
and
no
doubt
the
revolutionari
theme
wa
in
tune
with
hi
mental
result
is
a
complex
involv
plot
with
some
of
the
best
narr
write
to
be
found
anywher
and
the
recreat
of
revolutionari
pari
is
veri
convinc
the
devic
of
have
two
charact
that
look
ident
mai
seem
hacknei
to
modern
reader
but
it
is
here
emploi
with
greater
plausibl
than
in
twain
wilson
or
collin
the
woman
in
wa
inspir
to
write
thi
stori
by

carlyl
newli
publish
histori
of
the
french
revolut
those
event
and
their
aftermath
stood
in
relat
to
their
time
much
as
world
war
i
and
ii
do
to
our
that
is
fade
from
live
memori
into
histori
yet
their
legaci
still
veri
much
with
us
in
mani
novel
especi
russian
and
british
work
you
get
a
sens
of
uneas
among
the
aristocraci
that
the
revolut
will
spread
to
their
own
back
yard
in
the
case
of
russia
of
cours
it
eventu
have
often
recommend
a
tale
of
two
citi
as
a
good
introduct
to
dicken
for
younger
reader
thi
is
base
on
my
own
experi
becaus
it
wa
a
set
book
in
my
english
literatur
class
when
i
wa
15
and
i
rememb
thoroughli
enjoi
it
ye
it
is
challeng
with
it
somewhat
archaic
languag
and
it
slow
develop
but
you
can
not
progress
to
an
enjoy
of
great
literatur
without

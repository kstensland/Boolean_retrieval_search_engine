which
have
been
comment
on
often
brilliantli
by
amazon
review
i
would
therefor
like
to
restrict
my
comment
to
the
moral
of
the
book
and
to
those
who
to
thi
dai
view
the
book
with
outrag
even
those
who
admir
the
book
somehow
feel
compel
to
comment
that
thei
ar
disturb
by
it
why
is
thi
let
us
first
examin
the
novel
itself
as
everybodi
know
it
is
the
stori
of
humbert
humbert
a
adult
male
not
an
old
man
who
seduc
a
compliant
old
girl
and
then
goe
on
to
have
a
year
or
so
long
affair
with
her
i
put
the
term
affair
in
quotat
mark
becaus
it
probabl
is
appropri
to
describ
a
sexual
relationship
between
a
full
grown
male
and
a
femal
child
in
such
term
is
it
safe
to
sai
that
most
ration
human
be
disapprov
of
such
relationship
it
is
certainli
safe
to
sai
that
nabakov
and
hi
narrat
know
that
such
relationship
ar
wrong
thi
is
import
the
tale
is
not
onli
told
in
the
context
of
a
moral
univers
it
is
also
told
by
a
charact
who
is
in
accept
of
a
moral
univers
oh
he
make
a
comment
here
and
there
about
some
mediev
king
marri
hi
twelv
year
old
cousin
but
clearli
hi
heart
is
in
it
he
know
that
he
is
a
monster
a
brute
indeed
hi
goal
wa
never
to
have
sex
with
a
consciou
lolita
to
begin
with
hi
goal
initi
wa
onli
to
fondl
her
after
drug
her
to
induc
sleep
she
wa
never
to
know
what
he
wa
do
of
cours
thi
is
also
reprehens
but
clearli
it
show
a
conscienc
at
work
a
conscienc
motiv
in
part
by
fear
to
be
sure
but
also
a
conscienc
for
the
welfar
at
least
earli
on
of
thi
littl
girl
conscienc
is
not
normal
a
factor
in
pure
prurient
form
of
entertain
follow
thi
encount
he
take
lolita
on
a
journei
across
around
and
through
the
unite
state
live
in
hotel
room
and
bui
cloth
and
food
on
the
move
toward
the
end
of
thi
we
find
on
of
the
most
move
paragraph
in
literatur
and
so
we
roll
east
we
had
been
everywher
we
had
realli
seen
noth
and
i
catch
myself
think
todai
that
our
long
journei
had
onli
defil
with
a
sinuou
trail
of
slime
the
love
trust
dreami
enorm
countri
that
by
then
in
retrospect
wa
no
more
to
us
than
a
collect
of
map
ruin
old
tire
and
her
sob
in
the
night
everi
night
everi
night
the
moment
i
feign
sleep
the
narrat
revel
of
such
anguish
on
the
part
of
hi
victim
clearli
work
against
the
argument
that
thi
novel
wa
mere
intend
to
be
pornograph
humbert
make
it
clear
that
he
love
hi
lolita
there
can
be
no
mistak
about
thi
he
love
the
wai
she
move
he
love
the
down
on
her
arm
he
love
her
grace
on
the
tenni
court
he
love
the
wai
she
flick
her
head
at
him
when
look
up
from
a
book
he
love
her
toe
her
shoe
her
name
he
describ
her
in
beauti
poignant
poetic
languag
memor
and
move
in
everi
respect
indeed
the
english
languag
ha
rare
been
us
so
wonderfulli
but
nowher
in
thi
book
doe
he
describ
in
such
term
or
ani
other
term
her
sexual
characterist
or
comment
at
length
or
in
glare
detail
hi
physic
relat
with
her
final
there
is
no
effort
to
the
effect
of
all
of
thi
on
lolita
herself
we
learn
that
after
she
left
humbert
she
enter
into
a
seri
of
tawdri
sexual
escapad
still
at
too
young
an
ag
with
a
debas
playwright
we
last
see
her
in
her
late
teen
marri
to
a
bumpkin
and
live
in
a
clapboard
shack
surround
by
weed
obviousli
to
anybodi
who
ha
bother
to
read
thi
book
the
present
of
the
subject
matter
is
not
what
is
objection
therefor
what
appar
disturb
most
peopl
is
the
subject
matter
itself
but
why
why
doe
the
latest
grisli
novel
inspir
such
protest
ha
there
ever
been
a
time
in
the
histori
of
the
world
in
which
so
mani
novel
have
been
written
about
serial
killer
why
not
the
trash
by
daniel
steel
or
jacki
collin
or
the
latest
anne
rice
gore
fest
while
lolita
is
not
realli
a
moral
tale
it
certainli
doe
glorifi
it
subject
matter
the
wai
novel
such
as
these
do
so
what
is
it
i
think
that
with
lolita
nabakov
ha
perhap
unconsci
touch
a
nerv
we
as
human
ar
ration
creatur
we
know
what
is

and
we

that

of
thi
our

is
now
in

perhap
the

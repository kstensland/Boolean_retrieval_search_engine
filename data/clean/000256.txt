first
huge
statement
in
their

histori
a
groundbreak
live
album
the
first
of
it
kind
in
it
energet
sound
in
a
bundl
with
a
dazzl
studio
album
in
which
liber
piec
of
beauti
follow
bit
of
total
mad
a
problem
occur
onli
when
the
pastor
and
avantgard
part
run
simultan
but
thi
mere
appli
to
a
few
minut
the
studio
albumlet
face
it
mani
peopl
who
prais
thi
album
or
who
at
least
come
to
it
defens
whitewash
it
quit
a
lot
a
band
must
be
allow
to
experi
a
floyd
album
with
a
high
schoenbergian
demand
or
it
a
good
album
to
trip
on
the
review
often
sai
i
alwai
love
the
live
record
but
i
have
to
admit
that
i
too
had
lot
of
problem
with
the
studio
record
for
me
the
kei
to
understand
thi
complic
album
wa
understand
the
grand
garden
parti
the
flute
intro
and
outro
in
fact
compos
by
ron
geesin
and
perform
by
nick
mason
wife
ar
beauti
piec
of
classic
music
with
fairli
stiff
and
seriou
melod
at
the
first
listen
it
sound
like
a
pretti
chaotic
arrang
of
sound
effect
but
soon
you
realiz
that
the
entertain
part
itself
consist
of
four
differ
movement
the
first
on
is
minimalist
in
the
gradual
ad
of
differ
percuss
sampl
a
gong
a
triangl
a
wood
block
and
a
snare
drum
on
a
tape
loop
of
mason
tune
a
timpani
now
why
is
thi
experi
success
it
on
of
the
few
percuss
solo
which
ar
realli
atmospher
movement
on
add
an
eeri
melodi
on
top
of
the
carefulli
orchestr
percuss
tape
and
movement
two
consist
of
xylophon
suppos
mellotron
and
timpani
which
togeth
form
surreal
but
complet
harmoni
chord
in
the
vein
of
work
i
think
of
the
swan
in
particular
in
the
end
mason
construct
an
unexpectedli
tribal
and
grumpi
drum
solo
which
rise
and
rumbl
on
top
of
a
tape
loop
of
wood
block
and
cymbal
the
drum
sound
is
similar
to
ginger
baker
but
mason
is
more
deepli
root
in
jazz
music
henc
work
a
lot
with
subtl
time
differ
between
the
overdub
drum
take
mani
rock
musician
were
experi
with
around
the
year
1970
but
onli
few
were
success
and
nick
mason
is
on
of
the
few
who
make
it
thank
to
an
accomod
of
classic
structur
to
drum
music
instead
of
realli
noodl
david
gilmour
the
narrow
wai
is
to
me
the
most
impress
work
on
the
studio
album
not
onli
becaus
he
the
onli
on
to
record
a
piec
of
rock
music
plai
all
instrument
himself
but
also
becaus
the
narrow
wai
especi
part
three
is
the
music
blueprint
of
the
characterist
pink
floyd
sound
of
the
1970
add
rick
wright
ambient
keyboard
plai
and
roger
water
philosophi
and
you
ar
closer
to
the
spirit
of
dark
side
of
the
moon
than
on
ani
previou
pink
floyd
record
in
the
acoust
part
one
gilmour
transform
hi
countri
influenc
to
someth
bigger
into
gilmour
typic
peac
sound
which
total
set
your
mind
at
eas
if
you
just
listen
to
what
he
plai
you
can
not
discern
which
genr
of
music
gilmour
borrow
from
you
can
not
determin
what
kind
of
music
it
realli
is
or
what
it
about
but
the
clean
slide
guitar
and
the
constantli
flow
acoust
guitar
lead
you
into
a
sonic
ground
which
be
neither
real
nor
surreal
you
need
to
have
listen
to
weird
swirl
tape
effect
mark
the
begin
of
the
more
sombr
part
two
consist
of
more
stir
tape
effect
on
top
of
a
menac
guitar
riff
a
loud
siren
sound
lead
you
into
part
three
which
bring
all
of
the
previou
element
togeth
in
a
majest
piec
of
psychedel
rock
it
got
a
heavenli
choru
of
gilmour
overdub
falsetto
voic
with
lot
of
swirl
guitar
fly
around
in
everi
direct
gilmour
distinctli
chunki
bass
guitar
plai
the
float
drum
rhythm
plai
by
gilmour
as
well
which
is
surprisingli
stabl
in
it
time
and
sound
a
lot
like
mason
the
lyric
might
not
mean
anyth
concret
but
thei
manag
to
creat
a
movi
in
my
mind
a
movi
similar
to
what
the
lyric
of
ye
south
side
of
the
sky
express
in
a
clearer
fashion
i
can
not
point
out
how
much
i
like
thi
particular
piec
of
music
and
it
bare
understand
that
gilmour
todai
is
that
dissatisfi
with
thi
work
of
hi
still
i
have
to
admit
that
the
tape
effect
in
part
one
do
overshoot
the
mark
a
wee
bit
rick
wright
sysyphu
is
the
most
difficult
piec
on
ummagumma
it
ventur
a
lot
into
aton
and
avantgardist
realm
and
at
some
place
it
is
recklessli
shock
and
expressionist
someth
which
you
might
not
expect
from
rick
wright
who
otherwis
wa
respons
for
the
quieter
moment
on
the
pink
floyd
album
not
onli
onc
i
feel
remind
of
what
king
crimson
did
around
that
time
and
also
a
bit
later
part
one
is
a
pretti
mindblow
starter
to
thi
album
with
the
huge
mellotron
overdub
the
sophist
leitmotif
and
wright
mighti
timpani
overdub
king
crimson
mar
the
precursor
of
the
devil
triangl
which
thei
perform
in
1969
with
ian
mcdonald
on
mellotron
spring
to
my
mind
in
special
part
two
three
ar
fractur
and
aton
piano
piec
with
rhythmic
unsteadi
percuss
work
the
former
actual
begin
quit
neatli
with
sensit
impressionist
grand
piano
plai
but
dure
the
follow
four
minut
wright
bash
the
piano
as
heavili
as
keith
tippett
on
cat
food
and
part
of
lizard
but
still
ti
it
togeth
with
hi
characterist
harmon
concept
of
layer
perfect
and
augment
fourth
as
soon
as
wright
add
tape
of
him
wail
and
sing
on
top
of
thi
nearli
industri
beat
the
music
cut
total
loos
and
thi
is
where
wright
carri
on
with
a
most
beauti
keyboard
solo
of
3
minut
bird
sound
organ
some
bass
guitar
tune
and
a
bit
of
slide
guitar
and
interestingli
he
us
the
mellotron
string
again
augment
hi
typic
farfisa
organ
sound
consider
then
come
the
moment
which
supposedli
gave
mani
intox
listen
a
bad
trip
an
unexpect
and
frighteningli
loud
cluster
chord
shake
you
up
from
the
previou
sweet
sound
and
begin
a
tour
de
forc
of
accumul
sound
effect
and
keyboard
chord
includ
fade
slide
guitar
merg
into
an
even
more
majest
repris
of
the
main
theme
with
rick
wright
provid
harmoni
vocal
to
accompani
the
mellotron
a
good
kei
to
approach
thi
work
is
make
oneself
familiar
with
the
greek
sisypho
myth
contrari
to
for

anthoni

of

1984
which
bear

to

book
rick
wright
stai
quit
close
to
hi
literari
topic
repris
the
main
theme
in
the
end
after
an
excruci
central
part
of
cacophon
sound
is
a
strike
interpret
of
the
futil
of
sisypho
water
part
might
be
the
on
which
leav
the
biggest
question
mark
in
my
head
grantchest
meadow
is
basic
an
acoust
blue
piec
in
term
of
chord
progress
which
feel
absolut
like
british
folk
due
to
it
metr
and
melodi
the
song
is
calm
it
profit
a

from

even
though
he
doe
hit
all
the

and
is
beautifulli
arrang

and
but
after
all
there
not
a

happen
dure
the
7
minut
in
live
perform
rick
wright
perform
a
love
organ
solo
in
the
middl
of
the
song
with
a
tone
similar
to
an
english
horn
and
i
miss
thi
solo
a
lot
in
the
studio
version
the
littl
acoust
guitar
solo
which
water
perform
here
doe
attract
ani
attent
after
all
he
is
a
realli
invent
lead
guitarist
but
nonetheless
there
too
much
atmospher
and
too
good
lyric
to
be
bother
by
thi
piec
and
after
the
maelstrom
sysyphu
thi
piec
is
locat
at
a

good
posit
the
legendari

in

thi

most
atmospher

ha

i
enjoi

quit
a

still
i
think
that
i
have
fulli
got
what
the
track
realli
is
about
curious
the
first
measur
of
the
track
were
in
the
school
subject
of
music
an
import
topic
of
the

in
2011
the
precis
task
wa
to
compar
the
studio
version
to
the
live
version
as
anticip
thing
turn
out
a
bit
more
academ
than
fruit
but
at
least
i
wa
glad
that
schubert
and
vivaldi
were
the
onli
topic
to
deal
with
a
saucer
of
secret
is
as
reckless
as
it
ha
alwai
been
whilst
thi
version
replac
the
mass
of
tape
effect
and
sound
twiddl
of
the
studio
version
with
a
tighter
band
sound
my
favorit
version
is
doubtlessli
the
on
from
live
in
pompeii
thank
to
the
priceless
drum
sound
and
it
more
condens
form
but
it
the
ummagumma
version
which
come
closest
to
the
vandal
of
punk
music
rick
wright
work
around
on
the

the

thi

is
in

make
it
so
compel
and

a

without

would
have
been
a
difficult
territori
to

in

creep
broadli
like

guitar

of
the
syncop
pandemonium
part
calm
down

into

tonal

final
instead
of
the

of

david

take
over
the
lead

for
the
final

a
wise
decis
particularli
if
you
do
have
a
mellotron
or
as
i
state
a
few
paragraph
abov
a
church
organ
on

the
courag
of
thi
piec
ha
often
been
tri
to
reproduc
by
band
of
the
1960
and
1970
but
damn
complic
to
construct
a
function
longtrack
from
disarrang
sound
thi
experi
is
a
real
tough
listen
but
if
you
in
the
mood
it
a
great
and
singular
listen
version
of
interstellar
overdriv
wa
also
record
for
the
live

but
there
wa
not
enough
space
to
add
it
while
bear
similar
with
the
origin
barrett
version
it
is
fairli
deconstruct
and
a
more
academ
affair
than
ani
of
the
other
four
track
i
like
the
littl
surreal
part
of
pluck
and
click
and
i
sad
that
the
wave
of
pink
floyd
reissu
did
incorpor
record
such
as
these
but
i
think
that
in
1969
the
band
threw
the
right
song
out
of
the
list
given
that
thei
need
to
throw
on
out

animprov
in
comparison
to
their
debut
and
even
thought
there
huge
debat
and
opinion
about
which
album
is
the
first
true
prog
album
i
sai
it
thi
on
the
sound
is
experiment
but
it
is
in
a
wai
that
it
end
up
be
rather
well
achiev
and
the
band
is
clearli
in
better
control
of
their
output
it
better
achiev
in
both
music
tast
and
mix
which
even
though
it
still
not
perfect
it
consider
better
than
the
also
mark

of

be

thi
is
a

mani
floyd
fan
who
love
the
man
might
disagre
but
both
the
input

ultimat
their

wa
a
water
down
pink
floyd
music
when
you
compar
it
with
what
thei
were
plai
live
at
the
time
thi
is
much
more
popish
version
of
their
track
and
if
you
check
in
their
setlist
onli
an
hand
of
these
were
ever
plai
though
i
admit
syd
barrett
wa
obvious
the
music
leader
of
the
band
i
not
particularli
a
fan
of
him
the
music
is
that
bad
but
thi
record
is
awfulli
date
and
veri
attach
to
the
time
of
it
record
influenc
from
other
psychedel
band
is
veri
go
song
by

astronomi
domin
it
a
good
enough
jam
when
plai
live
it
usual
went
to
be
much
longer
but
it
doe
it
job
at
sound
quit
spacei
with
decent
enough
lyric
easili
on
of
the
best
song
from
the
barrett
era
good
seriou
sam
a
bit
edgi

catchi
and
overal
well
achiev
and
a
good
song
as
far
as
psychedelia
goe
good
matilda
mother
slightli
childish
but
overal
it

present
a

stori
in

wai
it
doe
thi
better
than
much
more
elabor
futur
work
by
other
band
good
flame
the
guitar
work
rather
well
but
the
stori
doe
work
that
well
it
a
bit
simplist
in
that
depart
but
overal
it
accept
some
of
the
sound
effect
ar
just
annoi

on

and
keyboard
depart
it
shine
realli
well
good
pow

h
at

thi
might
have
been

becaus
inde
it

it
doe

it
us
atyp
sound
even
though
i
like
more
the
live

without
lyric
good
take
up
thy
stethoscop
and
walk
the
first
on
that
is
that
impress
it
ha
a
few
good
idea
but
overal
it
doe
work
that
well
the
organ
doe
try
to
level
thing
up
and
save
it
but
it
too
errat
neutral
interstellar
overrid
possibl
the
best
track
of
thi

it
hypnot
and
rather
well
plai
the
instrument
fit
togeth
well

creat
an
averag
enough
space
tune
but
as
far
as
space
feel
it
doe
work
as
well
as
astronomi
domin
good
gnome
the
first
track
that
is
much
worth
pai
attent
it
rather
simplist
and
the
stori
is
silli
thi
is
the
type
of
stuff
that
could
onli
fly
in

lead
era
bad
chapter

better
than
the
on
befor
at
least
we
see
a
bit
of
interest
particip
by
the
bass
the
lyric
depart
end
up
be
quit
uninterest
i
blame
more
the
wai
it
wa
execut
rather
than
the
word
themselv
bad
scarecrow
it
doe
start
bad
but
the
sound
ar
like
a
thousand
mile
apart
from
what
it
should
sound
and
again
it
rather
simplist
in
a
bad
wai
only
get
interest
almost
at
the
end
but
the
sound
you
get
there
should
be
the
begin
of
the
track
and
us
it
as
the
melodi
bad
bike
the
end
is
rather
errat
and
too
long
but
the
song
work
it
simpl
but
drive
it
messag
home
my
main
complaint
is
that
if
there
a
song
that
suffer
from
the
bad
mix
from
thi
album
is
thi
on
it
just
doe
sound
that
well
good
now
as
far
as
the
progress
aspect
thei
plai
well
enough
i
think
that
in
particular
it
lack
keyboard
becaus
it
could
have
made
some
of
the
song
much
more
toler
neutral
even
though
it
might
look
i
harp
on
syd
i
not
i
think
he
a
compet
musician
and
a
good
vocalist
and
as
far
as
thi
he
doe
a
pretti
darn
good
job
but
the
lyric
content
i
find
it
lack
it
includ
load
of
fantasi
that
good
but
it
not
well
execut
be
mostli
with
an
heavli
popish
version
of
what
thei
could
have
done
neutral
even

roger
water
had
left
the

and
it
seem
as
though
pink
floyd
had
come
to
an
end
as
dramat
as
the
topic
that
thi
album
deal
with
war
at
the
time
i
had
becom
a
own
everyth
fan
of
the
band
so
i
had
a
good
scope
of
their
career
and
for
a
career
that
wa
full
of
odd
and
album
thi
on
mai
be
on
of
the
oddest
that
is
becaus
thi
is
more
like
a
roger
water
album
featur
pink
floyd
or
at
least
two
other
member
of
the
illustri
band
keyboardist
richard
wright
wa
out
water
wrote
and
sang
everi
song
except
now
john
the
onli
song
that
featur
david
gilmour
vocal
thi
is
also
a
concept
album
similar
in
vein
to
wall
with
background
voic
sound
effect
shuffl
footstep
an
orchestra
and
a
collect
of
song
relat
to
britain
and
lead
up
to
the
1983
present
indeed
it
wa
intend
origin
to
be
part
of
wall
is
a
special
album
becaus
of
it
veri
differ
and
veri
particular
conceptu
approach
for
some
it
mai
not
be
an
album
that
easi
to
get
into
but
even
back
in
my
junior
high
school
dai
i
could
feel
there
wa
someth
wonder
here
and
a
coupl
of
decad
later
i
realiz
that
thi
album
wa
sadli
miss
from
my
cd
collect
and
i
purchas
it
and
listen
to
it
again
with
thing
i
love
about
roger
water
is
hi
vocal
abil
i
believ
there
ar
singer
who
have
the
skill
to
hit
the
note
with
great
power
or
subtli
and
who
have
a
dynam
rang
peopl
like
geoff
tate
rob
halford
bruce
dickenson
ronni
jame
dio
rip
jon
anderson
and
ian
gillan
ar
singer
or
at
least
were
in
their
good
year
it
might
be
said
the
word
i
would
ascrib
more
to
peopl
who
mai
not
have
the
same
talent
as
a
gift
singer
but
who
make
us
of
their
voic
to
creat
drama
and
effect
peopl
like
peter
gabriel
and
deni
belang
of
voivod
suit
the
vocalist
appel
roger
water
ha
a
uniqu
wai
of
scream
whisper
and
sing
long
note
that
faulter
that
add
effect
to
the
song
rather
than
detract
from
it
he
can
enunci
clearli
and
emphas
word
sharpli
or
holler
just
outsid
the
edg
of
hi
rang
he
vocal
ar
often
charg
with
so
much
emot
that
the
messag
come
across
much
more
clearli
than
if
he
sang
like
geoff
tate
or
jon
anderson
and
sinc
mr
water
vocal
carri
us
through
the
album
the
whole
emot
rang
that
he
want
us
to
feel
is
the
vehicl
on
which
we
let
not
forget
the
rest
of
the
band
includ
the
background
singer
and
orchestra
there
is
so
much
featur
here
in
the
composit
that
the
band
pink
floyd
can
almost
be
forgotten
at
time
it
take
a
coupl
of
gilmour
solo
like
in
possibl
past
and
fletcher
memori
home
to
remind
you
that
there
is
other
talent
here
that
can
pull
at
your
emot
too
and
what
solo
david
gilmour
is
not
about
flash
and
speed
he
solo
straight
from
the
soul
speak
about
solo
with
apolog
to
saxophonist
everywher
i
am
not
a

of
the
instrument
but
the

particularli
after

in

metal
is
an
album
that
i
usual
have
to
listen
to
from
start

i
ca
seem
to
just
plai
a
track
or
two
most
of
the
time
it
interest
to
note
the
stori
and
drama
behind
the
album
thi
start
out
as
track
that
did
make
wall
and
david
gilmour
who
wa
veri
much
in
disagr
about
the
album
wa
note
as
sai
these
song
were
good
enough
for
the
wall
then
why
ar
thei
good
enough
now
in
fact
though
the
song
were
meant
to
be
part
of
wall
stori
the
outbreak
of
the
falkland
war
prompt
roger
water
to
rewrit
the
album
as
a
critic
of
war
there
been
a
lot
said
against
thi
album
but
i
think
it
a
brilliant
piec
of
work
and
a
rare
gem
among
the
million
of
rock
album
out
there
roger
water
claim
hi
sing
wa
poor
but
i
feel
it
realli
captur
a
lot
of
emot
much
of
which
is
rather
depress
but
in
that
wai
i
think
it
veri

given
the

thi
is

pass
thi

off
as
a

i

disagre
i
realli
consid
it
to
be
on
of
the
first

solo
work
which
i
ador
and
somewhat
lai
groundwork
for
the
futur
of
the

and
water
himself
seamu
is
on
of
those
track
but
mostli
hate
it
a

bluesi
record
with

at

a

which

ummagumma
pink
floyd
rock
review
by
pinkyesgongmachin
ummagumma
is
floyd
most
experiment
album
and
also
the
first
live
album
releas
and
onli
until
delic
sound
of
thunder
nearli
20
year
later
it
begin
with
the
live
album
featur
older
concert
stapl
astronomy
domine
thi
syd
barrett
classic
plai
live
without
barrett
is
a
slower
heavier
and
more
maniac
piec
on
ummagumma
my
least
favorit
piec
on
the
entir
album
it
is
still
take
you
to
a
bizarr
univers
especi
with
the
keyboard
solo
other
than
the
extens
and
the
spooki
slower
variat
it
not
so
much
differ
than
the
origin
careful
with
that
axe
eugene
alwai
a
favorit
in
everi
variat
thi
cwtae
is
similar
to
the
pompeii
version
and
is
extrem
eeri
and
veri
groovi
there
is
no
version
of
eugen
that
is
disappoint
set
the
controls
again
much
like
pompeii
thi
atmospher
classic
is
a
bit
monoton
but
you
ca
help
but
be
hypnot
by
the
drum
of
mason
and
water
mesmer
vocal
saucerful
of
secrets
although
the
pompeii
version
is
superior
the
ummagumma
version
of
asfos
is
far
better
than
the
studio
album
version
all
the
live
song
ar
highli
recommend
and
give
the
album
quit
a
boost
in
wright
contribut
is
an
exercis
in
classic
music
and
although
he
is
no
bartok
or
penderecki
he
ha
quit
a
talent
for
the
strang
and
spontan
the
open
of
sysyphu
is
a
heavi
piec
with
an
omin
almost

slowli
fade
in

ii
atmospher

that
flow
from
beauti

decai

into
part
iii
which
sound
like
anim
run
around
insid
a
piano
and
back
into
a
mellotron
for
part

the
mellotron
is
veri
peac
and
mellow
but
ha
a
sort
of
underli
eeri
feel
much
like
a
tale
from
the
darksid
feel
until
your
worst
fear
ar
confirm
with
a
sudden
organ
blast
and
the
return

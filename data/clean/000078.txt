he
had
turn
awai
from
when

when
an

thei

the

and

over

38
my
pitch
on
that
had
to
be
a
littl
more
detail
said
cameron
so
i
said
we
got
to
do
thi
whole
open
where
thei
explor
the
titan
and
thei
find
the
diamond
so
we
go
to
have
all
these
shot
of
the

cameron
state
now
we
can
either
do
them
with
elabor
model
and
motion
control
shot
and
cg
and
all
that
which
will
cost
x
amount
of

or
we
can
spend

and
actual
go
shoot
it

40
the

shot
at
the
real
wreck
in
the
atlantic
ocean
eleven
time
in

and
actual
spent
more
time
with
the

than
it
passeng
at
that
depth
with
a

pressur
of
pound
per

would

for

not

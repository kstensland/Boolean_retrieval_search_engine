in

a
thi

max
miller
offer
thi
explan
in
the
comment
below
saito
is
shot
on
the
first
level
of
the
dream
but
doe
die
until
the
third
if
thei
resuscit
him
on
the
third
level
it
would
onli
bring
him
back
to
the
second
where
he
wa
still
dy
and
if
he
surviv
that
then
it
would
onli
bring
him
back
to
the
first
where
he
wa
dy
the
fastest
anywai
meanwhil
sinc
fischer
wa
shot
on
the
third
level
and
sent
to
limbo
hi
bodi
on
the
other
two
level
were
total
fine
the
kick
from
the
defibril
time
correctli
with
the
fall
sensat
he
experienc
after
ariadn
push
him
off
the
build
wa
enough
to
bring
him
back
to
normal
level
3
so
he
could
complet
the
mission
if
she
had
just
shot
him
again
down
in
limbo
he
probabl
would
have
woken
up
for
real
and
the
mission
would
have
fail
arent
you
suppos
to
be
alon
in
limbo
why
ar
cobb
project
of
hi
wife
and
kid
there
a
our
understand
is
that
limbo
onli
contain
thing
youv
built
in
it
which
could
explain
why
cobb
limbo
ha
so
few
project
the
project
of
hi
wife
is
someth
he
tell
mal
at
the
end
that
he
tri
to
recreat
over
time
so
it
could
be
that
she
more
than
a
project
and
is
actual
an
intent
creation
of
hi
similarli
saito
could
have
creat
the
guard
which
popul
hi
limbo
if
the
world
with
crumbl
build
is
cobb
limbo
what
is
the
place
he
end
up
in
with
saito
a
two
differ
theori
possibl
let
break
them
down
on
at
a
time
theori
1
the
simplest
answer
here
would
be
that
thi
world
isnt
actual
limbo
but
a
deeper
level
which
perhap
cobb
ha
mistaken
for
limbo
or
misrepres
as
limbo
you
have
to
die
to
go
to
limbo
and
neither
cobb
nor
ariadn
di
in
the
ic
fortress
thei
mere
go
to
sleep
again
and
enter
cobb
dream
which
onli
resembl
the
world
he
and
mal
built
in
limbo
becaus
cobb
ha
creat
it
their
kid
were
with
them
in
their
origin
limbo
so
if
thi
were
limbo
again
why
would
thei
magic
be
there
with
them
to
live
happili
ever
after
also
cobb
could
have
deliber
been
plan
how
the
whole
level
work
out
he
us
it
to
detach
himself
from
mal
creat
a
project
of
fischer
to
compel
ariadn
to
get
out
and
not
go
into
limbo
and
stai
as
the
whole
thing
crumbl
to
get
to
the
real
limbo
to
help
saito
and
mayb
that
the
reason
fischer
can
be
reviv
he
wa
realli
shot
dead
theori
2
but
sinc
ariadn
tri
to
kill
herself
to
escap
it
and
we
know
that
kill
yourself
in
ani
level
but
limbo
will
onli
send
you
to
limbo
it
seem
as
though
ariadn
must
have
believ
she
wa
in
limbo
if
the
crumbl
citi
level
realli
is
a
form
of
limbo
could
that
mean
both
cobb
and
saito
in
limbo
but
in
differ
limbo
if
dream
ar
the
machin
of
the
subconsci
and
limbo
is
the
subconsci
that
cobb
ha
built
the
locat
ar
on
in
the
same
it
the
same
reason
why
cobb
can
no
longer
work
as
an
architect
perhap
cobb
and
saito
final
locat
ar
the
same
place
if
so
how
doe
cobb
find
saito
fortress
how
doe
he
end
up
on
that
beach
were
full
of
question
on
thi
on
but
given
the
context
of
the
movi
thi
theori
seem
like
the
most
like
of
the
two
why
is
saito
so
much
older
than
cobb
in
the
final
dream
level
a
it
like
that
cobb
and
saito
ar
in
limbo
for
the
same
amount
of
time
howev
cobb
know
he
in
limbo
so
perhap
thi
keep
him
from
ag
visibl
saito
on
the
other
hand
seem
to
have
forgotten
where
he
is
and
so
the
passag
of
time
which
could
have
been
decad
sinc
time
run
faster
the
deeper
you
go
ha
more
of
an
affect
on
him
similarli
the
first
time
cobb
and
mal
end
up
in
limbo
thei
ag
becaus
thei
forgotten
where
thei
realli
ar
and
accept
it
as
their
realiti
doe
cobb
totem
keep
spin
at
the
end
or
is
it
about
to
fall
off
the
tabl
a
the
fact
that
the
film
cut
awai
befor
we
know
for
certain
suggest
that
thei
want
us
to
keep
guess
but
we
think
it
kept
spin
here
our
reason
note
that
at
the
end
of
the
film
cobb
kid
havent
ag
thei
match
exactli
hi
memori
of
them
a
memori
which
must
almost
sure
by
now
be
out
of
date
sinc
he
been
awai
from
them
for
mani
month
though
he
final
see
their
face
otherwis
thei
look
exactli
as
he
envis
them
thei
even
wear
the
same
cloth
in
realiti
hi
kid
would
now
be
older
and
differ
than
hi
memori
of
them
thi
could
suggest
that
cobb
is
still
in
the
dream
and
the
top
doe
inde
keep
spin
after
the
credit
roll
alternat
theori
aaron
point
thi
out
in
our
comment
section
in
the
open
moment
you
get
a
glimps
of
leo
hand
specif
he
wear
hi
wed
ring
now
if
you
follow
the
rest
of
the
movi
keep
an
ey
out
for
thi
you
will
notic
that
he
onli
ha
the
ring
on
when
he
in
the
dream
world
at
the
end
of
the
movi
he
is
wear
the
ring
if
the
ring
onli
appear
when
he
in
a
dream
and
he
not
wear
at
the
end
of
the
film
that
could
be
confirm
that
in
fact
the
top
doe
stop
spin
after
the
credit
and
cobb
is
at
last
in
the
real
world
new
informat
even
though
cobb
kid
appear
to
be
wear
the
same
cloth
at
the
end
of
the
film
accord
to
inception
costum
design
here
thei
ar
inde
wear
differ
cloth
if
the
top
realli
doe
keep
spin
at
the
end
and
cobb
realiti
realli
is
a
dream
then
why
didnt
it
keep
spin
when
he
tri
it
earlier
in
the
film
a
assume
for
a
moment
that
cobb
is
still
in
the
dream
when
the
movi
end
it
doesnt
necessarili
mean
he
wa
in
a
dream
for
the
entir
film
the
cobb
we
see
at
the
end
could
in
fact
be
a
man
still
trap
in
limbo
thi
seem
unlik
though
sinc
the
film
seem
to
indic
that
saito
and
cobb
kill
themselv
to
escap
it
right
befor
wake
up
on
the
plane
see
altern
theori
alternat
theori
ivan
in
the
comment
below
suggest
that
it
still
possibl
that
the
entir
movi
could
be
a
dream
becaus
the
totem
mai
onli
work
to
ensur
you
not
in
someon
els
dream
think
about
it
you
know
your
totem
trick
exactli
so
if
you
were
in
your
own
host
dream
then
you
could
replic
it
perfectli
it
is
onli
when
you
ar
in
someon
els
dream
that
your
totem
doe
not
behav
in
it
trick
form
sinc
that
host
can
not
architect
it
so
thi
is
why
nobodi
know
the
trick
function
of
anyon
els
totem
how
do
cobb
and
saito
surviv
limbo
for
such
an
extend
period
of
time
isnt
your
mind
suppos
to
burn
out
in
there
a
the
film
never
actual
sai
your
mind
will
burn
out
there
mere
suggest
that
you
becom
lost
there
and
be
unabl
to
find
your
wai
out
the
real
obstacl
to
get
out
of
limbo
seem
to
be
realiz
that
you
in
limbo
at
the
end
of
the
film
it
take
an
appear
by
cobb
to
remind
saito
that
the
world
he
in
is
real
and
onc
he
realiz
saito
reach
for
a
gun
and
presum
shoot
himself
in
order
to
escap
it
could
be
that
your
brain
onli
actual
is
damag
out
if
you
stai
in
limbo
for
the
full
term
or
if
you
stai
there
after
the
machin
connect
power
the
dream
is
disconnect
if
the
dream
thei
enter
at
the
end
of
the
film
belong
to
fisher
then
why
doe
cobb
enter
the
limbo
he
built
with
hi
wife
shouldnt
it
be
fisher
limbo
a
the
snow
fort
dream
is
not
fisher
that
dream
belong
to
eam
each
level
is
dreamt
by
a
differ
member
of
cobb
team
and
then
fisher
subconci
is
brought
in
to
fill
it
the
first
level
is
dream
by
yusuf
who
then
stai
behind
to
drive
the

and
initi
a

to
bring

the

the

limbo
is
a
share
environ
not

to
a
singl
subconsci
limbo
contain
noth
excep
the
remnant
of
whatev
might
have
been

by
someon
who
ha
been
there
befor
cobb
ha
been
there
befor
so
limbo
contain
the
build
he
and
hi
wife
built
over
the
50
year
thei
spent
there
if
mal
and
cobb
grew
old
togeth
in
limbo
and
we
see
them
as
an
elderli
coupl
why
ar
thei
young
when
at
the
end
of
the
time
in
limbo
thei
kill
themselv
on
the
railroad
track
a
the
most
like
explan
for
thi
is
that
cobb
memori
of
their
youth
wa
mere
a
fantasi
of
hi
and
in
truth
thei
ag
togeth
as
we
saw
thi
is
support
by
the
film
the
first
time
we
see
cobb
envis
them
kill
by
the
train
thei
young
a
close
up
shot
of
their
hand
clasp
reveal
their
hand
to
be
young
as
well
later
when
cobb
tell
the
real
stori
of
how
thei
escap
limbo
we
see
their
hand
clasp
on
the
railroad
track
and
thei
older
and
wrinkl
just
as
cobb
and
mal
ar
when
we
see
them
walk
through
the
citi
while
cobb
talk
about
them
grow
old
togeth
it
seem
like
thi
is
the
true
version
of
the
stori
and
the
version
in
which
thei
younger
is
part
of
the
delus
cobb
construct
which
wa
visit
by
ariadn
how
did
cobb
and
mal
end
up
in
limbo
in
the
first
place
a
the
movi
suggest
it
wa
an
accid
caus
by
cobb
desir
to
keep
go
deeper
and
deeper
into
the
dream
until
he
went
too
deep
sever

wai
thi
could
have
been
accomplish
perhap
thei
us
the
same
type
of
sedat
as
yusuf
us
and
then
intention
kill
themselv
just
to
see
what
would
happen
why
did
cobb
perform
inception
on
mal
a
cobb
and
mal
were
trap
in

for
50
year
unawar
that
their
world
wa
real
cobb
eventu
discov
the
truth
but
mal
refus
to
accept
it
in
order
to
get
mal
to
kill
herself
and
return
to
the
real
world
cobb
perform
inception
on
her
plant
the
idea
that
the
world
wa
real
in

thi
work
thei
kill

unfortunatlei
the

thi
is
true
when

when
under

simultan
arthur
did

kick
readi
when
the

so
he

why
did

jump
off

up
with

kick
in

a

so
ariadn
know
that
death
is
a

even
though
in
thi
case
it
wa
necessari
alternat
theori
becaus
of
the
sed
it
mai
requir
two
synchron
kick
in
two
level
to
wake
someon
instead
of
the
singl
kick
normal
us
when
arthur
plan
hi
kick
why
is
it
import
for
everyon
to
wake
up
at
the
same
time
a
we
not
entir
sure
it
is
it
more
import
that
he
wake
them
up
quickli
when
it
come
time
for
the
kick
to
time
it
to
occur
at
the
same
time
as
the
kick
in
the
level
abov
by
put
them
in
the
elev
he
can
give
them
a
kick
all
at
onc
and
synchron
it
with
the
other
kick
what
did
cobb
put
a
spin
top
insid
the
safe
mean
a
the
safe
is
a
creation
of
the
subconsci
that
cobb
exploit
in
thi
case
mal
the
safe
ar
construct
so
that
the
dreamer
believ
that
it
is
a
safe
place
for
them
to
store
their
secret
the
top
is
mal
totem
which
she
us
to
determin
whether
she
in
a
dream
if
it
never
stop
spin
that
tell
mal
that
she
in
a
dream
by
place
a
constantli
spin
totem
in
the
safe
cobb
is
place
an
idea
and
a
veri
simpl
on
insid
her
subconsci
it
not
that
she
saw
the
totem
spin
but
that
it
wa
alwai
spin
in
her
subconci
mind
thi
is
why
she
thought
she
wa
trap
in
the
dream
world
why
did
cobb
need
to
us
inception
on
mal
to
convinc
her
to
kill
herself
could
he
have
simpli
snuck
up
on
her
and
shot
her
a
conciev
but
perhap
cobb
madli
in
love
with
mal
simpli
could
bring
himself
to
do
it
rememb
he
wa
bare
abl
to
shoot
a
project
of
her
it
might
be
all
but
imposs
to
kill
the
real
mal
no
matter
how
import
he
thought
it
wa
to
do
so

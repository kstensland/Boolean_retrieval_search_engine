i
found

well

stori
and
i
have
zero
complaint
about
the
strength
of
higgin
prose
in
addit
i
think
higgin
did
an
extrem
good
job
of
creat
three
dimension
nuanc
charact
that
came
to
life
and
appear
complet
human
includ
the
german
soldier
but
more
on
that
in
a
minut
final
higgin
did
an
fabul
job
of
construct
a
well
thought
out
highli
detail
and
credibl
plot
in
other
word
thi
ha
all
the
make
of
an
excel

in

and
holi
did
i
give

only

pleas
stop

at
me
and
i
will
tell
you
see
as
good
as
i
thought
the
novel
wa
on
a
technic
level
i
found
the
stori
itself
fairli
dry
at
the
best
of
time
and
actual
quit
bore
at
the
worst
of
time
now
bore
or
dry
when
deal
with
or
even

mai
still
earn
3
star
or

if
thei
impart

mean
or
just
load
you
up
with

howev

is
differ
i
read
that
to
enjoi
myself
and
so
dry
and
bore
becom
tough
hurdl
to
overcom
here
ar
my
four
main
one
of
the
reason
higgin
cite
for
the
popular
of
the
book
in
hi
introduct
is
that
it
wa
the
first
time
that
regular
german
soldier
as
distinguish
from
those
within
the
nazi
hierarchi
were
portrai
in
fiction
as
human
be
and
not
bloodthirsti
monster
while
the
portray
of
german
soldier
as
regular
peopl
is
certainli
laudabl
i
must
disagre
that
higgin
wa
a
trailblaz
in
thi
area
long
befor
thi
book
wa
evedwritten
the
world
had
been
introduc
to
the
follow
two
loveabl
scamp
and
how
do
you
not
love
klink
and
schultzi
so
sorri
higgin
but
as
far
as
i
am
concern
hogan
and
hi
band
of
hero
beat
you
to
the
punch
as
far
the
of
the
german
is
concern
thu
no
point
for
cultur
revel
2
the
fact
that
the
final
outcom
of
the
stori
wa
known
at
the
veri
begin
of
the
stori
took
awai
much
of
the
for
me
now
thi
is
not
alwai
the
case
when
read
about
real
life
event
in
which
the
final
outcom
is
well
known
as
i
have
read
a
lot
of
histor
ficiton
and
real
life
crime
fiction
that
kept
me
at
the
edg
of
my
seat
howev
in
thi
case
the
slow
method
plan
of
the
kidnap
just
never
seem
to
pull
me
in
and
so
i
found
the
stori
veri
slow
move
3
there
were
no
nada
zero
omg
moment
in
the
stori
which
is
a
real
let
down
for
me
as
i
would
have
expect
some
in
a
taut
thriller
of
thi
kind
for
me
omg
moment
ar
those
moment
that
rais
goos
bump
on
your

jack
nicholson
on
the

someth

no
way
did
that
just
happen
for
those
that
have
seen
the
blair

the
final

made
me
almost
crap

thei
ar
memor
scene
that
stick
to
my

long
after
i
have
forgotten
everyth
els
about
the
book
movi
thi
book
did
not
have
a
singl
moment
that
will
stai
with
me
for
more
than
10
minut
after
i
finish
thi
review
thu
no
point
there
4
final
while
most
of
the
charact
were
well
drawn
there
what
i
would
call
ani
real
standout
charact
thi
is
close
ti
to
3
abov
liam
devlin
the
ira

is

a
good
charact
howev
when

anxiou
to
pick
up
the
sequel
and
find
out
what
liam
would
do
next
he
just
did
stir

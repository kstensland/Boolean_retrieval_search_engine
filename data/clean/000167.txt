with
over
100
million
copi
sold
who
hasnt
heard
of
agatha
christi
i
love
read
book
that
have
puzzl
plot
yet
ive
read
so
few
and
so
i
thought
it
wa
time
to
pick
up
a
mysteri
classic
which
had
shall
we
sai
two
not
so
polit
correct
previou
titl
i
rare
come
across
a
book
that
i
am
abl
to
summaris
in
so
few
word
but
here
it
is
and
then
there
were
none
is
the
stori
of
ten
individu
who
ar
invit
to
an
isol
hous
on
soldier
island
devon
dure
their
first
dinner
togeth
a
record
messag
accus
each
of
them
of
a
terribl
crime
one
by
on
thei
begin
to
die
one
of
guest
must
be
the
killer
but
who
is
it
the
idea
for
and
then
there
were
none
is
so
simpl
yet
it
mustv
been
extrem
difficult
to
execut
agatha
christi
doe
it
brilliantli
and
the
book
deserv
it
prais
and
critic
acclaim
i
read
and
then
there
were
none
in
three
hour
without
put
it
down
a
complet
terrifi
and
thrill
experi
i
love
read
about
each
of
the
charact
at
the
begin
i
made
a
note
of
them
who
thei
were
and
how
thei
end
up
on
the
island
and
cross
them
off
as
thei
di
which
initi
wa
done
to
aid
my
memori
but
it
made
the
read
experi
much
more
excit
the
death
ar
not
at
all
gruesom
so
if
your
worri
about
that
dont
be
i
made
a
guess
as
to
who
the
murder
wa
i
wa
wrong
it
ha
an
absolut
brilliant
surpris
end
that
i
cant
imagin
anyon
would
figur
out
themselv
ive
onli
given
on

book
thi
year
so
far
the
rate
and
then
there
were
none
mai
not
be
a
book
ill
treasur
forev
but
after
read
it
i
want
to
enthusiast
recommend
it
to
everyon
i
knew
it
ha
those
moment
that
make
you
sit
up
and
gasp
and
wonder
how
you
didnt
notic
them
befor
i
genuin
had
chill
run
down
my
spine
as
as
that
mai
sound
it
extrem
well
pace
not
too
fast
not
too
slow
the
stori
ha
lot
of
detail
and
yet
the
chapter
feel
quit
short
it
all
add
to
the
eeri
atmospher
and
then
there
were
none
is
a
compel
introduct

constantli
kept
me

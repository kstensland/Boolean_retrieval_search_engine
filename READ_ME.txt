This directory contains all the necessary files for 2 lab assignment 
in an information retrieval course taught at Ithaca College by 
Douglas Turnbull.

The two labs combined consisted of a web crawler which searches the web for
a collection of web-pages. Then the tokens of the web-pages are cleaned,
stemmed and formatted. After, meta-data about each token and the number
of times it occurs across each document is collected and stored in a 
python dictionary object. This dictionary allows a search engine to perform
a series of boolean retrieval search queries across all the documents.
